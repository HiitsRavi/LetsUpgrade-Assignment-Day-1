1) After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain?
bacon = 22"
bacon + 1
bacon = 22
print(bacon + 1)
23

2) What should the values of the following two terms be?
'spam' + 'spamspam'
spam * 3"
'spam' + 'spamspam'
'spam' * 3
spamspamspam

3) How can you tell the difference between break and continue?
Ans-Break Statement: The 'break 'stop the continuation of the loop.
Continue Statement: The 'continue' does not stop the continuation of loop and it stops the current.


4) In a for loop, what is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1)?
ans:Difference is if we run range(10),it will print no form 0 to 9, and if we run range (0, 10) it will give same result excluding 10, and lastly when we run range(0, 10, 1) it will print the value from 0 to 10 by the diffrence of 1

5) Using a for loop, write a short programme that prints the numbers 1 to 10 Then, using a while loop, create an identical programme that prints the numbers 1 to 10.
for i in range(1, 11)
print(i)

i = 1
while i<= 10:
print(i)
i+= 1


6) Given a number x, determine whether the given number is Armstrong number or not
In : 153
Ans: YES
1 * 1 * 1 + 5 * 5 * 5 + 3 * 3 * 3 = 153 hens it is armstrong no.


7) Program to find Sum of squares of first n natural numbers.
n=int(input("enter a number"))
sum=0
for i in range (1,n+1):
    sum=sum+i
print("The sum is :",sum)



8) Program to Reverse words in a given String in Python.
str="Test match between India and England"
words=str.split(" ")
print(words)

words=words[-1::-1]
print(words)

outputstr=' '.join(words)
print(outputstr)


9) Given a list of numbers, write a Python program to find the sum of all the elements in the list.
    [10,12,13]
Ans:
mylist=[10,12,13]
total=0
for i in range(0,len(mylist)):
    total=total+mylist[i]

print("Sum of all element in given list:",total)


10) Write a Python program to print all even numbers between 10-1000.
n=1000
i=12
while(i<=1000):
    print(i)
    i=i+2
